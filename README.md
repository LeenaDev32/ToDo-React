## Demonstration Of ReactJS

In the project directory,
  - There are two files - home_page.jsx and swap_element.jsx

## Home Page
- It consists of Colwrapper to display the elements in column and RowWrapper to display the elements in row.
- In this, components can be duplicated, swapped, edited and deleted. We can also add a paricular component above or below an existing component. 

## Swap Element
- Implemented nested drag and drop functionality.
